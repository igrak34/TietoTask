# CString - wrapper for char*
## Compilation
In order to compile program "make" is necessary. Compilation is done by invoking 
```
make
``` 
in main repository directory. Then running the program needs simple command
```
./wrapper
```

## Tests
in main.c there is plenty of tests that check if wrapper acts valid. I used simple assertions to check if everything is correct, but I think that is enough for this level of complexity.
